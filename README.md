# open-source-specialization
This repository is a result of work done in [IDATA2506 - Computer science, specialization course](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2506#tab=omEmnet) at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/).  
Specialization chosen is **Contributing to Open Source** and the following is meant to  be a guide and overview on how to get started.  

## What is open source
- First we can refer to the "Open-Source" definition : Denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.
- In github, open source project can be refered as : A project where all of the work, the codebase and communication among users, is available for everyone in the open source community to see and interact with freely. 

## The Why and How of Open Source
### Why ?
An open source project can exist for many reasons but the most commons ones could be :
- Code sharing : The creator felt like it was important to reveal their coding and make it editable for everyone.
- Improvement : Theses creators believe that other people could help improving their project.
- Time save : Theses creators don't always have the time or the creativity to add new features so they can rely on other people.
