# open-source-specialization
This repository is a result of work done in [IDATA2506 - Computer science, specialization course](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2506#tab=omEmnet) at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/).  
Specialization chosen is **Contributing to Open Source** and the following is meant to  be a guide and overview on how to get started.  

## What is open source
- First we can refer to the "Open-Source" definition : Denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.
- In github, open source project can be refered as : A project where all of the work, the codebase and communication among users, is available for everyone in the open source community to see and interact with freely. 

## The Why and How of Open Source
### Why ?
An open source project can exist for many reasons but the most commons ones could be :
- Code sharing : The creator felt like it was important to reveal their coding and make it editable for everyone.
- Improvement : Theses creators believe that other people could help improving their project.
- Time save : Theses creators don't always have the time or the creativity to add new features so they can rely on other people.
### How?
- Contributing to open source can be done through the following steps:
   1. Find a project that aligns with your interests and skills.
   2. Fork the project's repository on GitHub.
   3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   4. Make changes or improvements to the codebase.
   5. Commit your changes and push them to your fork on GitHub.
   6. Create a pull request to propose your changes to the original project.
   7. Engage with the project's community, address feedback, and collaborate on further improvements.

## How to know if you can contribute
Contributing to an open source project requires some level of technical expertise, but it's not limited to programming skills. You can contribute in various ways, including coding, documentation, testing, design, and community support. To know if you can contribute, assess your skills and interests, and look for open source projects that welcome contributions in your areas of expertise.

## Healthy Projects
Healthy open source projects are those that are well-maintained, have an active community, and follow best practices in terms of code quality, documentation, and communication. Contributing to healthy projects is often more rewarding and impactful. 

### How to find healthy projects
- Explore open source repositories on platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
- Look for projects with recent commits, active issue discussions, and a responsive community.
- Check for clear contribution guidelines and a code of conduct in the project's repository.

## Required knowledge
To contribute effectively to open source projects, you may need the following knowledge and skills:

### Git
- Version control using Git is essential for collaborating with open source projects.

### Contribution Process
- Understanding the contribution process of a specific project is crucial. This typically involves creating forks, branches, making changes, and submitting pull requests.

### Project-Specific Expertise
- Depending on the project, you may need specific knowledge related to its domain or technology stack.

### Contribute Outside Source Code
- Contributions can extend beyond code, including documentation, bug reports, and community support.

## Communication and Collaboration
Effective communication and collaboration are vital in open source projects. Use project-specific communication channels, like mailing lists or chat platforms, to interact with the community. Be respectful and responsive in your interactions.

## Licensing and Legalities
Understand the licensing terms of the open source project you're contributing to. Respect the project's chosen license and ensure that your contributions comply with it.
